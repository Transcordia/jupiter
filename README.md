An open source Learning Record Store (LRS) supporting the xAPI and Caliper specifications

## Background

Scheduled for a 2014 delivery, are the new Caliper APIs for defining and storing learning
activities. This is a specification being developed by the [IMS](http://www.imsglobal.org/)
who have a proven history of working with some of the largest educational entities to
develop interoperability standards that tend to carry a lot of weight in the industry.

In some ways the Caliper API is a more formalized approach to defining a granular
learning activity specifically for the education sector. The goals of the effort
are laid out in the [Caliper Analytics](http://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/index.html) web page:

* establish a means for consistently capturing and presenting measures of learning activity, which
  will enable more efficient development of learning analytics features in learning environments
* define a common language for labeling learning data, which will set the stage for an ecosystem of
  higher-order applications of learning analytics
* provide a standard way of measuring learning activities and effectiveness, which will enable
  designers and providers of curriculum to measure, compare and improve quality
* leverage data science methods, standards and technologies
  build upon existing IMS standards

We see the introduction of the new Caliper API as a great time to bring new technology to bear on the problem of storing, querying and reporting on the vast amounts of data generated by learning interactions.

## The Current Landscape

* [Learning Locker](http://learninglocker.net/)   One of the first open source Learning Record Store (LRS) for the Experience API.
* [Scorm Cloud](http://scorm.com/scorm-solved/scorm-cloud-features/) and [Scorm Engine](http://scorm.com/scorm-solved/scorm-engine/) are SCORM and Tin Can API compliant LRS's developed by Rustici. The commercial company behind both the SCORM standard and Experience API (aka Tin Can API).
